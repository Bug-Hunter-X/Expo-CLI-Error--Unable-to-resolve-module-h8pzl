The solution depends on the specific module causing the issue.  If it's a third-party library, ensure it's installed correctly using `expo install <package_name>`. Verify the package is compatible with Expo by checking its documentation.  If the module requires native modules that Expo doesn't support, you might need to consider using Expo's bare workflow or finding an alternative library that works within Expo's managed environment. For example, if the issue is with 'react-native-camera', verify the latest version is compatible with your Expo SDK version, and that you've correctly followed all installation steps.

Here's an example of how to correctly install and use a library:

1. **Installation:**
```bash
expo install react-native-safe-area-context
```
2. **Import and Usage (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      {/* Your component content here */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
3. **Incorrect Import (bug.js - leading to the error):**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
// Incorrect import - package might not be installed or compatible
import { SafeAreaView } from 'some-incorrect-package';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      {/* Your component content here */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
